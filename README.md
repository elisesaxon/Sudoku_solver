# Sudoku_solver
A project for WWU Java programming class (CSCI 145)

This program intakes a text file containing a sudoku puzzle (9 rows, 9 columns 
of numbers with spaces between each number and 0s in place of empty squares) 
and uses recursion to solve that puzzle (prints solution to command line) or, 
if it's not solvable, prints a message that it is unsolvable.
